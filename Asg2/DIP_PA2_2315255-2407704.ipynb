Application of this technique produced outstanding results when implemented to the coffee image because its narrow ranged caused poor contrast before equalization. The image grew brighter together with increased detail content because the histogram expanded its coverage to span the whole available intensity spectrum. The pout image maintained its existing high contrast values before equalization while its intensity spread inadequately filled the complete range. Equalization provided additional contrast improvement to the darker parts yet its results were minute than the coffee image. But histogram equalization increased the contrast in both images`"

For instance, in case of an `uint8` image, the desired value range of a contrast-stretched image could be the full range from 0 to 255. \n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, one could perform contrast-stretching by selecting the minimum and maximum values of the original image and map these values to 0 and 255, respectively, and linearly scale all other pixel values in between accordingly. However, even a single outlier pixel value (high or low) can affect the input scaling range too much when outcome of the histogram stretching is not particularly good.\n",
